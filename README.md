# Time_Series_Forecast
A tractor and farm equipment manufacturing company, was established a few years after World War II. The company has shown a consistent growth in its revenue from tractor sales since its inception. However, over the years the company has struggled to keep itâ€™s inventory and production cost down because of variability in sales and tractor demand.  They want to be on top of their production planning to maintain healthy business margins. Monthly sales forecast is the first step we have suggested to this unit towards effective inventory management.
We will develop an ARIMA model to forecast sale / demand of tractor for next 3 years. Additionally, We will also investigate the impact of marketing program on sales by using an exogenous variable ARIMA model.
